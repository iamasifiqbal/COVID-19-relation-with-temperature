This Project is done to see the relation between Number of cases per million vs  temperature and Number of cases per million vs  humidity.

Information of the Excel file is taken from the WHO ( https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/ ) in 4 april 2020. Information about the temperature and Humidity is taken form https://www.timeanddate.com/ in time between 17 march to 3 april. Here we take the average temperature and humidity of that time-span

Here we approach Linear Regression in order to see the relation between them. Clearly we can see the slope is decreasing as the temperature is increasing. this clearly showing us a relation between these two parameters. Again we can see that there are no good relation between Number of cases per million vs  humidity
